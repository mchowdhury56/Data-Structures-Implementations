# Data Structures Implementations
Implementations of various data structures and operations in Java.

Projects I have worked on include:

BinaryNumber.java - Creates bianary numbers with integer and string input and can add 2 binary numbers.

IDLList.java - Implementation of a doubly linked list that uses an ArrayList for fast indexing. Junit test cases included.

Maze.java - Recurisive implementation using a stack and backtracking to find all solutions to a maze.

Treap.java - Implementation of a binary search tree that maintains heap properties. Junit test cases included.

HuffmanTree.java - Implementation of a Huffman encoding tree. Junit test cases included.

Below are a few data structures I implemented while I was a Course Assistant for a Data Structures course:
